# Marks 98/100
## General Remarks
Good work!
## Proper use of VSTS/Git: 20%
Contributions by all group members on git
## Correct and complete SQLServer/EF6 implementation: 20%: 18/20%
Some relationships can be modelled when you are creating your models to take advantage of automatic joins. Refer to the slides on EFcore relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc). This would enable you to get json which references other tables (eg, instead of getting User Id with comment end point you can get the user record.)
## Correct and complete ASP.NETCore API endpoints: 30% 30/30%
Good work!
## Full suite of Postman tests: 30/30%
Your postman export had URL values from assignment 1 and did not function as expected directly from the export. However, I could see that all the enpoints were captured as required.
